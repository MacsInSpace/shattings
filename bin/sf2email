# This shell script was originally designed to be used as the 'authors-prog'
# for git-svn. It takes the sourceforge username as an argument, and outputs
# the name and email address of the individual to stdout.
#
# The results are cached locally to speed up future checks.
#
# This script uses cURL to grab the user's sourceforge page and then scrapes
# their real name from the HTML.
#
# Up-to-date versions of this script can be found here:

#
# Warning: Currently only tested on MacOS X.
#
# Feedback and improvements are welcome!
