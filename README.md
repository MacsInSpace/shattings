## About ##

Shattings is a collection of scripts and settings which improve my own
productivity at the terminal. YMMV.

It is a work in progress. Not guaranteed to be useful for anyone
except me.

## Quick Install ##

If you have `curl` installed, type:

    bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.github.com/darconeous/shattings/master/quick_start.sh)"

If you don't have`curl`, but have `wget`, type:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

---

Another good complement to shattings on MacOS X is
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

[MouseTerm](https://bitheap.org/mouseterm/) is also useful for
enabling mouse support in vim.
