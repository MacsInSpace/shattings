## About ##

Shattings is a collection of scripts and settings which improve my productivity at the terminal. YMMV.

It is a work in progress. Not guaranteed to be useful for anyone except me.

## Quick Install ##

If you have cURL installed, type:

    bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.github.com/darconeous/shattings/master/quick_start.sh)"

If you have wget installed, type:

	bash -c "$(wget -O /dev/stdout https://raw.github.com/darconeous/shattings/master/quick_start.sh)"

------------------------

Another good complement to shattings on MacOS X is [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"
